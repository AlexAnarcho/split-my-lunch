#+TITLE: Split My Lunch

⚠️ Still under development

* About
A simple webapp that uses the Monero RPC Wallet and Viewkeys to allow co-workers to split the lunch bill.
* The work flow
- You would set the app up in the office and make the app available to the co-workers (either with the internal network or by hosting it on the internet).
- Then every coworker sets up a view only wallet by adding their viewkey to the config files
- Co-workers can create orders with invoices that update when the invoice has been payed
